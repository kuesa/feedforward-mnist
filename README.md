# feedforward-mnist
A feedforward neural network built to parse the MNIST data set

##Install dependencies:

python3
python3-pip

```
pip3 install numpy opencv-python python-mnist
```

---

Current Goals:

Add biases! -> there are currently no biases implemented in the code

Change squashing function -> sigmoid is old and clunky, maybe implement relu or something a bit more funky?

Make UI better -> i might move on to a different project before that happens
